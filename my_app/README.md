Added a checkout function to the shopping cart.

The program contains:
- a checkout button in the shopping cart that leads to a separate page
- a checkout page that contains the individual prices for each item, the total cost, and a 'Pay Now' button; these details are not visible when there are no items in the cart

The program lacks:
- better interface

Issues encountered while making:
- had trouble figuring out how to hide the details when cart is empty
